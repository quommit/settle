# settle
*settle* is an R package that lets you build a Neo4j graph database from a structured YAML document with spatial semantics such as land records identifying owners, neighbours, boundaries or lot clusters, but no geometry data. It also provides tools for traversing the graph and generate useful visualizations for exploring spatial patterns in the absence of numerical cartography.
